# slot_map
Contains a small implementation of slot_map I did out of interest, and to practice my C++. 

## To Compile
1. Clone the repo to your system
2. Open terminal and go into the repository
3. Run `mkdir build && cd build`
4. Run `cmake ..`
5. Run `cmake --build .`

Then, you can run the tests by running `cd build && ./tests/slot_map_test
